# Simplified Pairs Trading Using Machine Learning

## This project demonstrates an advanced implementation of pairs trading using machine learning techniques. The analysis focuses on identifying cointegrated pairs within the Indian banking sector, leveraging statistical methods like z-score normalization and the Dickey-Fuller test to ensure data stationarity.

## Key Highlights:

#### Signal Generation: Developed signal generation matrices for long and short trading entries based on z-score thresholds.
#### Machine Learning Model: Employed a Decision Tree Classifier to predict trading signals, achieving significant accuracy on test datasets.
#### Performance Evaluation: Optimized Sharpe ratios and visualized equity curves to assess the effectiveness of trading strategies.

## Features:
### Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.
#### Advanced signal generation based on statistical metrics and machine learning predictions.
#### Robust evaluation of trading strategies through metrics like Sharpe ratio and confusion matrices.
